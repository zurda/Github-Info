This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The purpose of this project is to allow users to view (and in the future - compare) github users, their activity, and contribution. 

### Demo 

https://zurda.github.io/Github-Info/

### Search and Sort
 
A version of this project with the addition of adding multiple users and sorting them is available here: https://github.com/zurda/github-user-finder

### To set up the project locally: 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. Go into the repo's folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

To access the api, you'll also need to set up a `.env` file in the root directory, and set two values: 

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_key
REACT_APP_API_SECRET=your_secret
```

Future versions goals: 

Short term
	- Improve styling
	- Add repos display
	- Add contributions display 
Longer term: 
	- Add ability to get a rank for a user 
	- Add ability to compare users 

### Contributions 

This project is absolutely accepting pull requests (first-timers welcome!)
